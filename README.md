# 🧠 Bedrock RAG Query Engine

A sleek and interactive frontend interface built with React to query your
Amazon Bedrock-powered Knowledge Base using the **Mistral 7B Instruct** model. 
This project demonstrates how to use AWS Bedrock Agents, Cognito, and vector 
search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adithya4code/AmazonBedrock.git
cd AmazonBedrock
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure your AWS credentials

Replace these placeholders in `App.jsx`:

```javascript
identityPoolId: 'YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID',         // From Amazon Cognito
knowledgeBaseId: 'YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID',       // From Bedrock Knowledge Base
```

Make sure your IAM roles for Cognito Identity Pool allow access to Bedrock.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 How it Works

1. **Frontend**: React app lets you input queries.
2. **Authentication**: AWS SDK uses Cognito Identity Pool to get credentials.
3. **Bedrock Agent Runtime**: Sends `RetrieveAndGenerateCommand` to retrieve relevant knowledge and generate responses using Mistral 7B.
4. **Response**: Result is shown in the UI and saved to local history.
